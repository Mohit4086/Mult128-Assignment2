      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) is a large species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus <em>Panthera</em>. It is most recognizable for its muscular build, deep chest, and, in males, an impressive mane. Lions are social animals that live in groups called prides, a trait unique among big cats.</p>

      <h2>Habitat</h2>
      <p>Historically, lions were found throughout Africa, Asia, and Europe. Today, they primarily inhabit Sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population surviving in the Gir Forest National Park in India. They prefer open woodlands, savannas, and scrubland, avoiding dense forests and deserts.</p>

      <h2>Diet</h2>
      <p>Lions are obligate carnivores and apex predators. They mainly hunt large herbivores such as wildebeest, zebras, and buffalo. Female lions do most of the hunting, often working together to stalk and ambush prey. They are also known to scavenge when necessary.</p>

      <h2>Behavior</h2>
      <p>Lions live in prides, typically consisting of several related females, their cubs, and a few adult males. They communicate through vocalizations, including roars that can be heard from miles away. Lions are mostly nocturnal and spend much of the day resting, conserving energy for nighttime hunts.</p>

    <!-- Reproduction -->
    <section id="reproduction">
      <h2>Reproduction</h2>
      <p>Female lions typically give birth to 1-4 cubs after a gestation period of about 110 days. Cubs are born blind and rely heavily on their mothers. Male lions usually protect the pride from rival males, which may kill cubs to bring females into estrus sooner.</p>

    <!-- Conservation -->
    <section id="conservation">
      <h2>Conservation</h2>
      <p>The lion is classified as "Vulnerable" on the IUCN Red List due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. Conservation efforts include protected areas, anti-poaching patrols, and breeding programs. Raising awareness and supporting conservation organizations can help ensure the lionâ€™s survival.</p>
